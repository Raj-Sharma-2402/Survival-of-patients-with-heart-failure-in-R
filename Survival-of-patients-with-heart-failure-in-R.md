================

**Source of data:** UCI machine learning
repository:<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/519/heart+failure+clinical+records>

**Upload date of data:** 2nd April 2020

**Owner of the data:** The original dataset version was collected by
Tanvir Ahmad, Assia Munir, Sajjad Haider Bhatti, Muhammad Aftab, and
Muhammad Ali Raza in 2015. Current dataset has slight difference from
original dataset in terms of names of columns which was done by D.
Chicco and Giuseppe Jurman in their article published on BMC Medical
Informatics and Decision Making.

**Objective of data collection:** Dataset was collected for analyzing
the survival pattern of heart failure patients who were admitted to
Institute of Cardiology and Allied hospital Faisalabad-Pakistan during
April-December (2015). And also rank the features which corresponds to
the most important risk factors.

**Analysis of data by other researchers:** D.Chicco and Giuseppe Jurman
found in their analysis that serum creatinine and ejection fraction
plays a very important role in understanding if a patient will survive
after heart failure or not.This discovery has the potential to impact on
clinical practice, becoming a new supporting tool for physicians when
predicting if a heart failure patient will survive or not.

**Description of data set:** This dataset was collected during
Aprilâ€“December 2015.It contains the medical records of 299 heart failure
patients collected at the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and at the
Allied Hospital in Faisalabad (Punjab, Pakistan). The patients consisted
of 105 women and 194 men, and their ages range between 40 and 95 years
old. All 299 patients had left ventricular systolic dysfunction and had
previous heart failures that put them in classes III or IV of New York
Heart Association (NYHA) classification of the stages of heart failure.
The dataset contains 13 features, which report clinical, body, and
lifestyle information.

The hospital physician considered a patient having **anaemia** if
haematocrit levels were lower than 36%.<br> The **creatinine
phosphokinase (CPK)** states the level of the CPK enzyme in blood. When
a muscle tissue gets damaged, CPK flows into the blood. Therefore, high
levels of CPK in the blood of a patient might indicate a heart failure
or injury.It is measured in microgram per litre (mcg/L).<br> The
**ejection fraction** states the percentage of how much blood the left
ventricle pumps out with each contraction.<br> The **serum creatinine**
is a waste product generated by creatine, when a muscle breaks
down.Doctors focus on serum creatinine in blood to check kidney
function. If a patient has high levels of serum creatinine, it may
indicate renal dysfunction.A normal range for serum creatinine is
approximately 0.6 to 1.3 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) for adult
males and 0.5 to 1.2 mg/dL for adult females.<br> The **serum sodium
test** is a routine blood exam that indicates if a patient has normal
levels of sodium in the blood. An abnormally low level of sodium(\<125
mEq/L) in the blood might be caused by heart failure.mEq/L represents
milliequivalents per liter.<br> The **death event** feature, that we use
as the target in our binary classification study, states if the patient
died or survived before the end of the follow-up period, that was 130
days on average.<br>

## **Purpose of my project:**Carrying out EDA to look for important factors for predicting survival of patients from heart failure.

Since age is measured in years and platelets are count so they are
integer columns, thus converting them into integer. By description of
dataset we know that anaemia,high blood pressure,diabetes,sex and
smoking are categorical columns which are encoded with 0 and 1.

fraction decreases representing that blood pumping capacity of heart
decrease whenever heart injury occurs.

**Key findings:**<br> 1)Ejection fraction, Serum sodium and Serum
creatinine can be considered as important factors to predict survival of
patients. 2)Females are more prone to anaemia and diabetes than males.
3)Smoking can cause decrease in pumping capacity of heart. 4)Presence of
CPK enzyme may be considered for detection of heart injury.
